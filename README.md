# Budget Baron
A budget app created using HTML5, CSS3 and ES5 Javascript.
This project was built to practice the module pattern.

### What I learned:
- Use of the object constructor function
- Creating and deleting objects conditionally
- Use of the forEach() method
- Creating basic data structures
- Data formatting using the abs(), toFixed(), split() and substr() methods
